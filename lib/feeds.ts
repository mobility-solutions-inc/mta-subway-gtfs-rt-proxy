// Note: We use the "supplemented" instead of the "regular" GTFS feed.
// > Every day, the feed will contain a seven-day lookahead, so in principle a developer can download that and use it for the next seven days, then refresh the feed to get the next seven days – but we recommend updating more frequently (ideally daily) to get the latest updates and have valid data for the next seven days.

// > Outside of the seven-day window, the new supplemented feed will contain the same information as the existing static GTFS feed.
